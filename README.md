# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

Bootcamp can be filled with information so, The Prework Study Guide webpage was made to help students organize the abundance of information they learn.
This website will help busy students organize their notes for studying and easy future reference
It solves the problem of forgetting information learned and having messy unorganized notes, also the notes are easily accesible from any location as they can be pulled up in a web browser.
I learned how to code a webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, how to build the structure of a webpage, style the webpage, and make it interactive using variables, if else statements and functions.
This project stands out because this is the first project I completed.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this website all you need to do in open the console. In the console the user can view the topics we learned in the bootcamp prework. A random topic will also be generated in the console so the user or bootcamp student can have a topic to study for that day or study session. The user can also view notes of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript in a organized bulleted list to review and learn information from the prework in bootcamp on the website itself.
